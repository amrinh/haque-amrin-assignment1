                        <p>Hey guys! My name is Amrin. I started cooking around the age of 6 years old. When I was younger, my dream was to become a chef and have my own Food Network show. That ended up not happening but it did not stop me from cooking.</p>

                        <p>For the past 8 years, I switched to a plant-based diet and have been innovating new ways to make dishes as delicious from when I wasn't vegan. <strong>AKA: no boring salads, green wrap... you get what i am saying.</strong></p>

                    <h2>What is this about?</h2>

                    <p>This blog features some of my favoriteeee dishes that are very easy to make (for the most part). I try my best to keep the recipes simple and effective since I am a college student after all! <em>And a little bit on the lazy side</em></p>

                    <p><em>I hope you will be able to recreate and make these dishes in your own and special way. The more twists the better! Make it so that it has <strong>your love and your vision.</strong></em></p>

                    <p>Look at my recipe one <a href ="recipe-one.html">here</a></p>.
